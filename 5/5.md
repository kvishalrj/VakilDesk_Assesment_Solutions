>## Q.5: Write a function aggregate_data(data: List[Dict], key: str, aggregator: Callable) that aggregates values from a list of dictionaries. The function should group the dictionaries by the provided key and apply the aggregator function to the grouped values.

### Plan:
1. We'll manually group the dictionaries by the given key.
2. Once the data is grouped, the provided `aggregator` function will be applied to the grouped values.
3. We'll use a dictionary to store the grouped data, where the key is the value from the dictionary for the given key, and the value is a list of values associated with that key.


### Explanation:
- **Grouping**: We manually group the data by iterating over the list of dictionaries, using the provided key to determine which group each dictionary belongs to. The grouped data is stored in a dictionary where each key is the `group_key`, and the values are lists of dictionaries that share that key.
- **Aggregation**: After grouping, we apply the `aggregator` function to each group. The aggregator function can be any callable that performs a desired operation on the list of dictionaries in each group.

### Example Usage:

Letâ€™s say we have a list of dictionaries representing sales data:

```python
from statistics import mean

data = [
    {'region': 'North', 'sales': 100},
    {'region': 'South', 'sales': 150},
    {'region': 'North', 'sales': 200},
    {'region': 'East', 'sales': 130},
    {'region': 'South', 'sales': 170},
    {'region': 'East', 'sales': 110},
]

# Aggregator function to calculate the total sales for each region
def total_sales(group):
    return sum(item['sales'] for item in group)

# Aggregator function to calculate the average sales for each region
def average_sales(group):
    return mean(item['sales'] for item in group)

# Example 1: Aggregate total sales by region
result_total = aggregate_data(data, key='region', aggregator=total_sales)
print(result_total)  # {'North': 300, 'South': 320, 'East': 240}

# Example 2: Aggregate average sales by region
result_avg = aggregate_data(data, key='region', aggregator=average_sales)
print(result_avg)  # {'North': 150, 'South': 160, 'East': 120}
```

### Explanation of Example:
- **total_sales**: Aggregates the total sales for each region by summing up the values in the `sales` field.
- **average_sales**: Aggregates the average sales for each region using the `mean` function from the `statistics` module.

### Benefits:
- **Flexible Aggregation**: You can define any custom aggregator function, such as calculating the sum, mean, median, or even more complex operations, and pass it to the `aggregate_data` function.
- **Manual Grouping**: This implementation manually groups the data without using external libraries like `itertools.groupby`, which was a given constraint.
