>## Q.3: Suppose you have a Django model Order with fields customer, order_date, status, and total_amount. Implement a method to get the top 5 customers who have spent the most in the last 6 months. Provide an example of how you would use this method in a view. 

### 1. Create the Django Model

First, you need to define the `Order` model in `orders/models.py`. 

### 2. Create a View to Use This Method

Next, you need to create a view in `orders/views.py` that will call the `get_top_customers` method and render the results.

### 3. Create a Template to Display the Results

You need a template that will display the list of top customers. Create an HTML file for this purpose.

### 4. Set Up URL Routing

You need to set up a URL route for the view you just created.

### 5. Include the App URLs in the Project URL Configuration

Make sure your app's URLs are included in the main project `urls.py`.

### 6. Migrate the Database

Run the following commands to create the necessary database tables for your models.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Create Sample Data (Optional)

You can create some sample data for `Customer` and `Order` models using the Django admin interface or the Django shell.

To create a superuser and access the admin panel:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Log in to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and add some `Customer` and `Order` entries.

### 8. Run the Development Server

Finally, run the development server to access your view:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 9. Access the Top Customers Page

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/top-customers/` to see the top customers who have spent the most in the last 6 months.
