>## Q.6: Find Duplicate in Array with O(1) Extra Space: Given an array of n+1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n, find the duplicate number. The solution must not use extra space. 

### Explanation of the Code

The function `find_duplicate(nums)` aims to find the duplicate number in an array containing \( n + 1 \) integers where each integer is between 1 and \( n \). 

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `xor_result` is initialized to `0`. This variable will store the cumulative XOR of the elements in the array and the indices.

2. **Single Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each index \( i \) in the range of the array length.
   - For each iteration:
     - It XORs the current element `nums[i]` with `xor_result`. This accumulates the XOR of all elements in the array.
     - If the index \( i \) is greater than 0 (to skip the first index), it also XORs \( i \) with `xor_result`. This accumulates the XOR of all integers from 1 to \( n \) (as the indices of the array represent numbers from 0 to \( n \)).
   
3. **Return Statement**:
   - After the loop completes, `xor_result` holds the XOR of all elements and the XOR of all numbers from 1 to \( n \). 
   - The final result, which is returned, is the duplicate number. This works because the XOR of a number with itself cancels it out, leaving only the duplicate.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The function iterates through the array once, leading to linear time complexity, where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The function uses a constant amount of extra space (just the `xor_result` variable) regardless of the input size.
