>## Q.1: Write a Python script that scrapes the titles and URLs of the latest articles from a news website (CNN etc). Use BeautifulSoup and requests for this task. 

### Explanation:
1. **requests**: Used to fetch the HTML content from the website.
2. **BeautifulSoup**: Parses the HTML and extracts the necessary data.
3. **Find articles**: The script targets the `h3` tags with the class `cd__headline` (specific to CNN).
4. **Extract titles and URLs**: It gets the text (article title) and the link (URL) from each article.
5. **Complete URLs**: If the URL is relative (starts with `/`), it adds the base URL to form the complete link.

### Libraries to Install:
You'll need to install `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` if you don't have them:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```
