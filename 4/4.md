>## Q.4: Implement a rate limiter in Python that limits the number of requests a user can make within a given time window.

### Approach:
1. We'll maintain a dictionary where the key is `user_id` and the value is a list of timestamps representing the request times.
2. We'll use the `threading.Lock` to handle concurrency issues since the dictionary will be accessed and modified by multiple threads simultaneously.


### Explanation:

1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
   - `max_requests`: Maximum number of requests allowed per user.
   - `time_window`: Time window in which requests are counted (in seconds, set to 60 seconds for 1 minute).
   - `requests`: A dictionary that tracks each userâ€™s request timestamps.
   - `lock`: A threading lock to handle concurrency safely.

2. **allow_request(user_id)**:
   - We get the current time (`time.time()` returns the current time in seconds).
   - The lock ensures that only one thread accesses the `requests` dictionary at a time, preventing race conditions.
   - We filter out the timestamps that are older than the time window (i.e., more than 1 minute ago).
   - If the user has made fewer than the allowed requests within the time window, we allow the request and log the timestamp. Otherwise, we deny the request.

### Example Usage:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    rate_limiter = RateLimiter(max_requests=5, time_window=60)

    user_id = "user_123"

    for i in range(7):  # Simulate 7 requests
        if rate_limiter.allow_request(user_id):
            print(f"Request {i+1}: Allowed")
        else:
            print(f"Request {i+1}: Denied")

        # Simulate a small time gap between requests
        time.sleep(10)
```

### Explanation of Example:

- The script simulates 7 requests from the same user, `user_123`. Since the user is allowed 5 requests per minute, the first 5 requests will be allowed, and the next 2 will be denied.
- A 10-second delay between requests is added to simulate real-world request intervals.

### Handling Concurrency:

- **Thread safety**: The `threading.Lock()` ensures that even in a highly concurrent environment, only one thread modifies or accesses the `requests` dictionary at a time, preventing race conditions.
- **Time filtering**: We keep only the requests that are within the last 60 seconds, ensuring accurate rate limiting.

This rate limiter can be used in a real-time system where multiple users make requests simultaneously, and it will ensure that no user exceeds the allowed request rate.
